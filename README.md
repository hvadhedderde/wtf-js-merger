js-merger
=========

JavaScript merger, optimized to work with Detector device-segments

Production preparation tool which merges multiple JavaScript files into one file, 
removing empty lines and inline comments.


Note on lack of minification:
Does not (and should not) minify the JavaScript as the minification process is considered excessive, 
disabling meaningful debug output with obscurity in production evironments. Well structured JavaScript 
and optimized webserver delivery of fewer files easily provide greater 
optimization than minification.
